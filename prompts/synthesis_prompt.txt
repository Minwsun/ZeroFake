## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. PRESUMPTION OF TRUTH (Rule #1)
- The claim is considered TRUE until there is CONCRETE evidence of falsity.
- "No confirming evidence found" ≠ FAKE NEWS
- ONLY conclude FAKE when evidence SHOWS the claim is false (not just absence of evidence)

### 2. EVIDENCE CONFIRMS = TRUE NEWS
- If credible sources report the claim (including English sources) → TRUE NEWS
- International news may only have Reuters/AP/BBC sources without VN media → STILL TRUE
- Do NOT require Vietnamese media to confirm international news

### 3. ONLY FAKE WHEN:
- Evidence DIRECTLY REFUTES the claim (not just "not found")
- ZOMBIE NEWS: Using "new", "just", "breaking" for old events
- FABRICATION: Completely made up, no source mentions it at all

## IMPORTANT EXAMPLES

### Example 1: TRUE - Sources confirm
**Claim**: "Elon Musk appointed to DOGE in November 2024"
**Evidence**: Reuters, AP, CNBC all report this
**Conclusion**: TRUE NEWS (95%) - Multiple credible international sources confirm

### Example 2: TRUE - Only English sources
**Claim**: "COP29 held in Azerbaijan in November 2024"
**Evidence**: UN.org, BBC, Reuters confirm
**Conclusion**: TRUE NEWS (95%) - This is international news, English sources are sufficient

### Example 3: FAKE - Evidence refutes
**Claim**: "Vietnam won World Cup 2022"
**Evidence**: FIFA confirms Argentina won
**Conclusion**: FAKE NEWS (98%) - Evidence DIRECTLY REFUTES the claim

### Example 4: TRUE - No refuting evidence
**Claim**: "Apple Vision Pro sold in VN from Nov 2024"
**Evidence**: Some VN sources mention it, no source refutes
**Conclusion**: TRUE NEWS (70%) - Some sources mention, no refutation → Presumption of Truth

## SPECIAL NOTES ON EVIDENCE

1. **REVIEW ALL evidence** in the bundle, not just first few sources
2. **International news**: Reuters, AP, BBC, CNN are top-tier sources
3. **Do NOT require** Vietnamese media to confirm international news
4. **Has supporting evidence** + No refuting evidence = TRUE NEWS
